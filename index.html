          Sir Alex Ferguson is a legendary Scottish football manager best known
          for his long and extraordinarily successful tenure as the manager of
          Manchester United. Born on December 31, 1941, Ferguson managed the
          club from 1986 to 2013, establishing himself as one of the greatest
          managers in the history of football. Under Ferguson's leadership,
          Manchester United experienced an unprecedented era of success. He
          guided the team to 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups, 4 League Cups,
          and 2 UEFA Champions League titles, among numerous other domestic and
          international honors. His ability to build and rebuild successful
          teams over different eras, along with his skill in nurturing young
          talents and making astute tactical decisions, played a crucial role in
          the club's dominance. Ferguson's management style was characterized by
          his motivational skills, strategic acumen, and an unyielding drive for
          excellence. He was known for his "hairdryer treatment," an intense
          form of verbal dressing-down used to motivate players, and his keen
          eye for talent, often signing and developing players who would go on
          to become superstars. Even after his retirement in 2013, Sir Alex
          Ferguson remains a highly influential figure in football, and his
          legacy at Manchester United and in the sport as a whole is enduring
          and profound.

          Charlton, George Best, Eric Cantona, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Wayne
          Rooney. These players have not only brought glory to the club but have
          also become iconic figures in world football. Manchester United's
          rivalries are a significant part of its identity. The club has intense
          rivalries with Liverpool, known as the North West Derby, and with
